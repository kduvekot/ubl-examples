## What is expected
This is one review among possibly several of this example (other runs and parts; list them with
`list_reviews.py`). Whoever works through the reviews considers every one of them: runs find partly
different things, and a finding that appears in only one review counts as much as one that appears
in all. Every finding below, and every entry under "Considered and refuted", "Refuted in the merge"
and "Outside this review", is looked into and ends either resolved (its condition holds) or
dismissed with a stated reason. Findings marked "Needs decision: yes" are confirmed by a person
first. The example must remain valid against the UBL 2.5 schemas and the world's code lists. This
review only describes what is wrong; it does not say where or how the example is produced.

## Findings

### tender/11#F1 · Medium · A language code in `LocaleCode`
- XPath: `/UnsubscribeFromProcedureResponse/cac:EconomicOperatorParty/cac:Party/cac:Language/cbc:LocaleCode` = `en`
- XPath: `/UnsubscribeFromProcedureResponse/cac:ContractingParty/cac:Party/cac:Language/cbc:LocaleCode` = `en`
- Why: `LocaleCode` is "a code signifying the locale in which this language is used". The value repeats the ISO 639 language code of `Language/ID` (list "ISO 639"); a language is not a locale (a locale would name the country or region whose conventions apply). The element adds nothing to `ID` and carries a meaning other than its definition. The same pattern (an ISO 639 language code in `LocaleCode`) occurs in 213 of the 250 examples (counted with `grep -l LocaleCode world/examples/*/*.xml`).
- Condition: A locale element, where present, identifies a locale (language plus territory, or the territory), from a list of locales; otherwise it is absent.
- Options: (a) Preferred: remove `LocaleCode` where it only repeats the language. (b) Use locale identifiers (e.g. `en-XB`) with a matching list.
- Needs decision: no

### tender/11#F2 · Low · Customs trader numbers of the parties in an unsubscribe confirmation
- XPath: `/UnsubscribeFromProcedureResponse/cac:EconomicOperatorParty/cac:Party/cac:AdditionalPartyIdentification/cbc:ID` = `XB-TR-412329`
- XPath: `/UnsubscribeFromProcedureResponse/cac:ContractingParty/cac:Party/cac:AdditionalPartyIdentification/cbc:ID` = `XB-TR-410548`
- Why: The parties are identified also by their customs trader numbers. Nothing here is declared to customs. They look copied from the parties' master data into a document that does not use them (section 4.8 of the review method: data the document does nothing with).
- Condition: A party carries the identifiers the document uses or the receiver needs to identify it; no customs trader number in a tendering document.
- Options: (a) Preferred: leave the customs trader numbers to the customs and transport documents. (b) Keep them if the world's rule is that every document carries all identifiers of a party; then that rule should be stated.
- Needs decision: no

## Checked and consistent
- `UnsubscribeToProcedureDocumentReference` `MS-DOC-26-0196` is 10, issued the day before by the operator this confirmation is addressed to; project, lot and folder agree with it.
- The note says what the document type is for ("confirming that the latter has been unsubscribed"). 2026-02-23 is a Monday.
